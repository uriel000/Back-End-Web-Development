# Express JS
## Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js

Express Helps Us To:
- Start up a server to listen for requests
- Parse incoming requests
- Match those requests to particular routes
- Craft our HTTP response and associated content


I've learned about:
- The Request and Response Objects
- Basics of Express Routing
- Query Strings
- app.get
- app.post
- app.listen
- app.use
